Healthcare Analytics: Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project focuses on building a predictive system that leverages machine learning algorithms to identify the risk of chronic diseases, specifically diabetes, based on various health parameters. Early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes and managing healthcare costs in today's digital healthcare landscape.

The system is trained on real-world medical datasets and uses input features such as Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, and Age to assess disease likelihood.

Features
Real-time Disease Prediction: Predict diabetes risk for a single patient through an interactive web interface.

Batch Prediction via CSV: Upload a CSV file containing multiple patient records for simultaneous predictions.

Interactive GUI (Web-based): A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit, requiring no technical knowledge to operate.

Model Performance Visualizations: Dashboard includes:

Confusion Matrix

ROC Curve

Feature Importance plots (for tree-based models)

Clear Dark/Light Theme: Provides a comfortable dashboard experience.

Tools & Technologies
Frontend/GUI: Streamlit (Python-based Web UI Framework)

Language: Python

Machine Learning Models:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Decision Tree Classifier

Libraries Used: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, joblib

Dataset: PIMA Diabetes Dataset (from UCI Machine Learning Repository)

Deployment: Streamlit Community Cloud

How to Run Locally
To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/uttam-kumar11/Healthcare-Disease-Prediction.git
cd Healthcare-Disease-Prediction

Set Up a Conda Environment:

conda create --name disease_env python=3.9
conda activate disease_env

Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

(Ensure your requirements.txt file contains the necessary packages, as provided in the project.)

Run Jupyter Lab (Optional - for development/analysis):

jupyter lab

Open diabetes_prediction.ipynb to see the data preprocessing, EDA, and model training steps.

Run the Streamlit Application:

streamlit run app.py

This will open the app in your web browser at http://localhost:8501.

Deployment
This application is deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud and can be accessed publicly.

Live App URL: (This will be added once your app is successfully deployed)
